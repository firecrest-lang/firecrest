# Firecrest 🔥

***As Powerful as Node.js, as Slick as Wren***

## What ❔

⚙️ A modern programming language with a C-like syntax, inspired mainly by Wren but also JavaScript and Go.

⚙️ Reduce visual noise, and make programming feel cleaner to read and easier to write.

⚙️ Meant to be a clean little scripting language, powered by a rich ecosystem.

⚙️ Have a standard library small enough to learn in a day, but large enough to be used in production.

⚙️ Be extensible, with the ability to implement your own Node.js functions as Fircrest functions.
